 Prompt the user to enter the cost of the meal, the tax rate, and the tip percentage.
  Calculate the final cost using arithmetic operators and display the total.
 Hint: Total Cost = Cost of Meal + Tax Amount + Tip Amount
 Tax Amount: Tax Amount = (Tax Rate / 100) * Cost of Meal
Tip Amount: Tip Amount = (Tip Percentage / 100) * Cost of Meal  */
