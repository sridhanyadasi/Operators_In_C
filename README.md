# Operators in C

This repository is created to help beginners understand the concept of **operators in C programming** with clear explanations and simple examples.

--------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 Why Do We Use Operators?

We use operators to:
- perform calculations
- compare values
- assign values to variables
- apply conditions and logic
- make programs meaningful and functional

Without operators, a program cannot process data or produce results.

--------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 How Many Types of Operators in C?

C language mainly provides the following six types of operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators  
2. Relational Operators  
3. Assignment Operators  
4. Logical Operators  
5. Unary Operators  
6. Ternary Operator  

--------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 Types of Operators and Their Usage

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical calculations.

Examples: +, -, *, /, %

📌 Used when:
- performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or remainder operations

Example:
result = a + b;

--------------------------------------------------

### 2️⃣ Relational Operators

Used to compare two values and return true (1) or false (0).

Examples: >, <, ==, !=, >=, <=

📌 Used when:
- checking conditions
- making decisions using if, while, or for loops

Example:
a > b;

--------------------------------------------------

### 3️⃣ Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

Examples: =, +=, -=, *=, /=

📌 Used when:
- storing or updating values in variables

Example:
a += 10;

--------------------------------------------------

### 4️⃣ Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

Examples:
&&  (AND)  
||  (OR)  
!   (NOT)

📌 Used when:
- checking multiple conditions at the same time

Example:
(a > 10 && b < 20)

--------------------------------------------------

### 5️⃣ Unary Operators

Operate on a single operand.

Examples: ++, --, !

📌 Used when:
- incrementing or decrementing values
- changing a condition

Example:
i++;

--------------------------------------------------

### 6️⃣ Ternary Operator

A conditional operator that works as a short form of if-else.

Syntax:
condition ? value1 : value2

📌 Used when:
- making quick decisions in a single line

Example:
max = (a > b) ? a : b;

--------------------------------------------------

## 🔹 Focus of This Repository

Although C has many types of operators, this repository focuses only on the following three:

✔ Arithmetic Operators  
✔ Relational Operators  
✔ Assignment Operators  

The programs in this repository are designed to help beginners clearly understand these operators with simple examples and outputs.

--------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- To understand operators clearly  
- To practice basic C programming  
- To strengthen core C concepts  
- To build a strong foundation for advanced topics
